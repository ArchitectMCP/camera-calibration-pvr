ChangeLog
---------

Version 0.3.1
- Scene name is not hardcoded anymore.
- Changed the use of the rad2deg() function to the builtin math.degrees().

Version 0.3:
- Added an algorithm for calculating vertical and horizontal lens shift along
  with focal length, position and rotation of the camera. Additional
  information is taken from two dangling vertices in the mesh.
- Separate button for the new calibration method.
- Renaming of the calibration methods.

Version 0.2:
- Added an algorithm for calculating vertical lens shift along with focal
  length, position and rotation of the camera. Additional information is taken
  from one dangling vertex in the mesh. The rectangle in the image is required
  to have one pair of parallel edges.
- Separate button for the new calibration method.
- Adding a camera to the scene when none exist.
- Bugfixes

Version 0.1: First official release. It includes the following features:
- Algorithm to calculate focal length, position and rotation for the camera
  used to make a picture of a rectangle.
- The image used for calibration is taken from the viewport background from Top
  View.
- A mesh of four vertices in one polygon is used to determine the coordinates
  of the rectangle corners.
- A button in the tool shelf performs the calibration when the mesh is
  selected.
- A new rectangle is created during the calibration which represents the
  undistorted rectangle in the image.
- The active camera is transformed according to the calculation results.
- The view automatically changes to camera view.
- Options for the calibration are:
  - the size of the reconstructed rectangle
  - vertical alignment of the reconstructed rectangle
